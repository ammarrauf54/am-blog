    <h2><b>INTRODUCTION :</b></h2>
    <p>Every journey has a beginning, and my coding journey also started with simple curiosity. I was always interested in technology and computers, but I used to think coding was very difficult. When I wrote my first piece of code, I realized that coding is just like learning a new language.</p>
    
    <h2><b>BODY :</b></h2>
    <b>1. The First Struggles:</b>
    <p>When I started coding, my biggest problem was with syntax errors and small mistakes. Sometimes I missed a semicolon, and other times I placed brackets incorrectly. At that time, it felt like coding was not for me.</p>
    
    <b>2. The Learning Process:</b>
    <p>But slowly, I began to understand the basics — like variables, loops, and functions. I learned through YouTube tutorials and free websites. With every small practice, my confidence started to grow.</p>
    
    <h2><b>CONCLUSION :</b></h2>
    <p>Today, I am still in the learning process, but I no longer feel scared of coding. My journey has taught me that if you have patience and consistency, learning to code is not that hard. Every line of code teaches me something new and motivates me to move forward.</p>
    
    <h2>Closing Note :</h2>
    <p>“Coding is not just a skill; it is a way of thinking.” My coding journey has just begun, and I believe this path will one day make me a professional coder.</p>
